# resume_tool

Created a tool to parse CV in pdf format and build a table of the candidates profiles and skills as required by the user.

Skills.csv is where the needed skills can be saved and used to parse CVs or resumes and also represent the skills as a graph

Dump all the resumes into a single folder and copy the file path then paste it on the 'mypath' variable in the 'init' file and sit back.

Working on making this a web application
